All notable changes to the Neomania podcast website will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - v1.0.0 ðŸŽ‰

### [2025-06-15]

#### Added

- **Responsive Episode List Component**: Implemented multi-breakpoint episode list that adapts to LG, M, S, and XS screen sizes with complex CSS Grid layout matching Figma specifications.
- **Custom Eleventy Filters**: Added specialized filters for date formatting (`MM/dd/yy`) and duration formatting (`XHr Ymin`) to enhance data presentation.
- **Design System Integration**: Integrated new design system tokens (colors, fonts) into the theme for consistent visual styling.

#### Changed

- **Episode List UI**: Transformed episode listing from basic layout to sophisticated responsive component with live data integration and professional visual design.

#### [2025-06-15] Addendum

#### Added

- **Numbered Episode Structure**: Migrated from slug-based episode files to numbered directory structure (`src/episodes/01/`, `src/episodes/07/`, etc.) for better organization and cleaner URLs (`/ep/01/`, `/ep/07/`).
- **Supplemental Content System**: Episodes can now include co-located supplemental files (`transcript.md`, `expanded-notes.md`, `guest-links.md`, `corrections.md`, `media/`) with automatic detection and display.
- **Custom Episodes Collection**: Implemented explicit Eleventy collection (`src/episodes/*/index.md`) to ensure proper episode discovery and sorting by episode number.
- **Enhanced Episode Templates**: Added conditional supplemental content sections using `<details>` elements that automatically appear when additional content is available.
- **Supplemental Content Flags**: Extended episode frontmatter with boolean flags (`hasTranscript`, `hasExpandedNotes`, `hasGuestLinks`, etc.) to track available supplemental content.
- **Episode Management Scripts**: Enhanced scaffolding script to create numbered directories, detect supplemental content, and set appropriate frontmatter flags automatically.

#### Changed

- **Episode URL Structure**: Simplified episode URLs from `/ep/long-episode-title-slug/` to clean numbered format `/ep/07/` using episode number as primary organizational key.
- **Episode Discovery**: Episodes now use episode number rather than filename for organization, making it immediately clear which episode is which in the file system.
- **Permalink Generation**: Updated permalink structure to use `{{ episodeNumber | padStart(2, '0') }}` for consistent two-digit formatting.
- **Content Co-location**: All episode-related content (transcripts, notes, media) now lives alongside the main episode file for better organization.

#### Enhanced

- **Developer Experience**: Episode management is now much more intuitive with numbered directories and co-located supplemental content.
- **Scalability**: Structure works seamlessly whether you have 10 or 100+ episodes, with clear migration path for future season/year-based organization.
- **Content Workflow**: Adding supplemental content is now as simple as dropping files in the episode directory and updating frontmatter flags.

## [2025-06-14]

### Added

- **Content-Driven Architecture**: Implemented a robust data pipeline that converts RSS feed items into local Markdown files (`/src/episodes/`), which now serve as the canonical source for all episode content.
- **Episode Scaffolding Script**: Created a non-destructive script (`npm run fetch-episodes`) to automatically generate new episode Markdown files from the feed without overwriting existing, manually edited content.
- **Annotation System**: Developed a sophisticated annotation layer (`episodeAnnotations.js`) to enrich episodes with structured metadata like tags, featured status, and custom slugs for cleaner URLs.
- **Individual Episode Pages**: Added layouts and routing to generate unique pages for each episode (e.g., `/ep/7-stochastic-funnerism-and-autonomous-media/`).
- **Smart Caching System**: Implemented intelligent caching with different refresh intervals for development (5min), production (1hr), and CI environments (always fresh).
- **HTML-to-Markdown Conversion**: Added `turndown` library integration to convert RSS HTML content into clean Markdown for better content management.

### Changed

- **RSS Integration Architecture**: Transitioned the site from being data-driven (reading from a live-fetched JSON object) to content-driven (building from a collection of local Markdown files).
- **Modernized to ES Modules**: Updated the entire project configuration, including `.eleventy.js` and all scripts, to use modern ES Module syntax (`import`/`export`).
- **Episode URL Structure**: Updated episode slugs to include episode numbers in both titles and URLs (e.g., `/ep/7-stochastic-funnerism-and-autonomous-media/`).
- **Fixed CSS Overflow Issue**: Scoped global overflow styles to landing page only using `:has(#noise-canvas)` selector to prevent scrolling issues on content pages.
- **Major Architecture Refactoring**: Extracted monolithic index.html into modular components
  - Moved all inline CSS to dedicated `css/landing.css` file (12KB+ of styles)
  - Extracted all JavaScript functionality to `js/main.js` (365 lines of code)
  - Updated base layout template with comprehensive head tags and asset linking
  - Transformed index.html into clean content-only file using Eleventy front matter
  - Restructured about page to use unified layout system with content-pane wrapper
  - Streamlined style.css to focus only on content page styling
  - Updated Eleventy configuration to handle new asset directories
  - Preserved all existing functionality: theme toggle, font animations, canvas background, platform icons, email protection
  - Improved maintainability and scalability for future Figma design implementation
  - Enhanced performance with proper asset caching and separation of concerns
