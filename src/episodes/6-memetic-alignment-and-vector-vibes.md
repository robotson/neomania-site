summary: "Exploring AI alignment, meme theory, and how high-dimensional spaces are reshaping human knowledge. I'm joined by @deepfates, an internet thinker, dirtbag futurist, and meme theorist. We dive into the nuances of AI alignment beyond the typical pro/anti dichotomy and explore how language models are creating a new relationship between humans and semantic space. We examine the memecoin AI Agent \"Bot Swarm Incident\" as a real-world AI alignment challenge, discuss my concept of the \"Vector Episteme\" - how high-dimensional mathematical spaces are transforming our understanding of knowledge itself, and consider why magical metaphors provide surprisingly useful frameworks for understanding our relationship with AI. Throughout, we consider how making relations with non-human minds might shape plural futures where diversity of thought and being is valued. -it's ya boi Links: Deepfates: https://x.com/deepfates https://deepfates.com https://deepfates.blog Your Host, Lance \"it's ya boi\" Robotson: https://x.com/robotson https://bsky.app/profile/robotson.media"

_Exploring AI alignment, meme theory, and how high-dimensional spaces are reshaping human knowledge._
