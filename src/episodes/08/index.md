I went to Vibe Camp 2025 with a laptop harness and a USB mic, looking for impromptu conversations with anyone willing to be recorded. What emerged is a cross-section of how some very online people are thinking about our weird futures.

• The Promethean vs. Titanocratic dynamic  
• What kinds of futurisms age best
