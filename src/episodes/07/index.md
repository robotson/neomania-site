summary: 'A deep dive into media evolution, generative chaos, attention economics, and the uncertain frontiers of digital culture In this episode, I''m joined by digital performance artist, developer, musician, and creative provocateur, @somewheresy. Together, we explore our turbulent media ecosystem—one where longevity grows elusive, songs become shorter and catchier by algorithmic necessity, and the temperature of attention economics continues to rise. We discuss the evolving role of podcasts as both a medium and genre still in its infancy, question why legacy media icons maintain cultural dominance despite the fragmentation brought on by the internet, and consider whether the coming explosion of generative AI media will drown us in endless slop – or open radical new possibilities for creativity, parody, and even digital civil disobedience. Along the way, we trace internet culture from Flash-era absurdism to "YouTube Poop" remixes, reflect on why deep fakes may represent vital tools for artistic freedom, and speculate on how autonomous media—where AI-driven generative systems produce infinite, unpredictable content—could challenge the hegemony of established media institutions.

_A deep dive into media evolution, generative chaos, attention economics, and the uncertain frontiers of digital culture_

In this episode, I'm joined by digital performance artist, developer, musician, and creative provocateur, @somewheresy. Together, we explore our turbulent media ecosystem—one where longevity grows elusive, songs become shorter and catchier by algorithmic necessity, and the temperature of attention economics continues to rise.

We discuss the evolving role of podcasts as both a medium and genre still in its infancy, question why legacy media icons maintain cultural dominance despite the fragmentation brought on by the internet, and consider whether the coming explosion of generative AI media will drown us in endless slop – or open radical new possibilities for creativity, parody, and even digital civil disobedience.

Along the way, we trace internet culture from Flash-era absurdism to "YouTube Poop" remixes, reflect on why deep fakes may represent vital tools for artistic freedom, and speculate on how autonomous media—where AI-driven generative systems produce infinite, unpredictable content—could challenge the hegemony of established media institutions.

_What happens when everyone has their own personal Hollywood studio in their pocket? Are we heading toward media singularity or generative chaos?_

Join us as we navigate these provocative possibilities—and the futures they might unlock.
