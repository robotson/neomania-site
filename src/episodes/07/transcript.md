# Episode 7: Stochastic Funnerism and Autonomous Media

## Full Transcript

**Lance**: Welcome to Neomania, I'm Lance "it's ya boi" Robotson, and today I'm joined by @somewheresy, a digital performance artist, developer, musician, and creative provocateur...

**@somewheresy**: Thanks for having me on, Lance. I'm excited to dive into this chaotic media landscape we're all swimming in.

**Lance**: Let's start with this concept of "stochastic funnerism" - can you break that down for our listeners?

**@somewheresy**: Sure! So stochastic just means random or probabilistic, right? And funnerism is about making things fun, but in a way that's almost accidental. It's like when you throw a bunch of random elements together - algorithms, user-generated content, AI systems - and something unexpectedly delightful emerges from the chaos.

**Lance**: That's fascinating. It makes me think about how YouTube's algorithm sometimes surfaces these weird, wonderful combinations of content that no human curator would ever think to put together...
