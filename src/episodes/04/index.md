_Exploring radical friendship, alternative futures, and the struggle for dignity in a techno-capitalist world._

I'm joined by The Homie aka Marcos (@AinterShow), the charismatic force behind The Ain't Shit Show, and architect of "Homeism." We dive into his audacious philosophy where being kind might just be the most radical act of all. Our conversation spans from Silicon Valley's shortcomings to why the future must include space for everyone - not just the privileged few. And if we can sell you an apocalypse prep food bucket along the way, all the better.
