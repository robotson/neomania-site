_Discussing Large Language Models, Climate Pessimism, and Technoprogressive Optimism._

  

I'm joined by Spencer (@\_ontologic) , a web developer, co-host of the _AI Rebels_ podcast, and builder of various AI experiments. We explore the evolution of our experiences using Large Language Models, how technology might save us from (or accelerate) climate collapse, and why creating an optimistic future requires new narratives about technology’s role in social coordination and collective problem-solving.
